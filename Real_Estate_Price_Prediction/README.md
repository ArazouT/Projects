The objective of this project is to estimate the prices of single-family dwellings in Austin, TX, based on historical sales data between 2018 and 2021. By leveraging various features such as location, property size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other relevant factors, the model aims to provide reliable estimates for future property prices. Accurate house price prediction is crucial for several reasons: it aids potential buyers and sellers in making informed decisions, helps real estate professionals set competitive prices, assists appraisers and mortgage lenders in evaluating property values, and supports city planners and policymakers in understanding market trends and housing affordability. This can ultimately contribute to a more transparent and efficient real estate market.

The dataset, scraped from Zillow, was acquired from Kaggle. It's a regression problem with the label(latestPrice) present. The evaluation metrics are R2 & RMSE.
