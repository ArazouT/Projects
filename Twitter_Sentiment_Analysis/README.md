### The idea

---

- To conduct sentiment analysis on the tweets posted during two crucial dates in November 2022 with the hashtag #Iran.
- Analyze tweets to gain insights into how individuals have utilized Twitter as a platform and identify the prevailing viewpoint among the Twitter community during those specific dates.

### The process

---

- Utilized PySpark on the Databricks platform to clean, process, and analyze 680k+ tweets and to build a machine-learning model to make predictions on the overall sentiment of the tweets.
- The final pipeline was built using Logistic Regression to predict sentiments populated through the package TextBlob.
- Used AWS Athena and SQL to create tables to build an interactive dashboard on AWS Quicksight to visualize findings.
