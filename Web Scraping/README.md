To conduct a statistical analysis of various fitness classes available on [ClassPass.com](http://ClassPass.com) in the greater Toronto area and gather insights relevant to potential investors or fitness enthusiasts. 

Some of the questions I aimed to address were:

- Are there any areas that are underserved in certain fitness categories?
- Is there a difference in class fees between weekdays and weekends?
- Which class categories are more popular among users?

- Utilized BeautifulSoup and Selenium packages on Python to scrape the data of 1,700+ classes offered in a span of a week in January 2022.
- Cleaned and transformed the data using Pandas.
- Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Analyzed different features including class types, prices, ratings,â€¦ across different cities.
- Through the analysis, identified high ROI potential cities that are underserved in certain categories, similarly categories that generate a lot of enthusiasm on the platform but are undersupplied.
