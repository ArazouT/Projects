To conduct a statistical analysis of various fitness classes available on [ClassPass.com](http://ClassPass.com) in the greater Toronto area and gather insights relevant to potential investors or fitness enthusiasts.

- Are there any areas that are underserved in certain fitness categories?
- Is there a difference in class fees between weekdays and weekends?
- Which class categories are more popular among users?
